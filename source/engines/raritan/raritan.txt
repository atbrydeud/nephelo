Raritan notes


- Outlets have associated sensors to provide the infeed data.
- SensorType tells the type of sensor as an int.
- The sensor reading is in "CurrentReading"

You can filter out the properties by using -d properties with the show command to return only what your interested in. i.e.
clp:system1-> show -d properties=name ncurrsensor15
/system1/ncurrsensor15
 Properties:
  Name is R.08 Current(56.0.32)


SENSORS
-------------
The name identifies what the sensor measures
Current - RMS Current
PwrFactor - Power Factor
Max Curr - Maximum Current
Act. Power - Active Power
Apt. Power - Apparent Power
Volt - Voltage


Sensor types:
1 (Other) //details are in the OtherSensorTypeDescription field
2 (Temperature)
3 (Voltage)
4 (Current)

nsensor
  - SensorType 1 (Other)
  - OtherSensorTypeDescription is [Power Factor|PowerUnit|Active Energy (measured in watt-hour)]
  - Active Engery doesn't seem to be being used by anything.

  - What is the difference between Power Factor and PowerUnit?


ncurrsensor
  - SensorType 4 (Current)
  - Device Name - <outlet id> Current | <outlet id> Max Curr 
     - Current is the current in amps
     - Max Curr is the Max RMS Current in maps...//I don't think we use this.

  - There seems to be two types of current sensors differentiated in the Name field.
    - Name is Max Curr
    - Name is Current
  - I think we're interested in the Current sensor only. Max Curr has no reading

ntempsensor - only shows the onboard sensor

externalsensor - shows humidity and temperature
  - SensorType is 2 (Temperature)
  - SensorType is 1 (Other)  - OtherSensorTypeDescription is Humidity

  - If the sensor is there the Status will read 
	"Status is Sensor is avaiable"
  - If an external sensor isn't conencted, the Status of the sensor will read:
	"Status is Sensor do not exist"

   - I could parse the whole response for "Sensor is available". If it is, match against Humidity or Temperature. And get the CurrentReading field.



nvoltsensor - This measures the voltage of the PDU. Looks like these are the infeeds.

Model

outlet (PDU Element)

        //Outlet Current (Amps)
	private String load = null;	//ncurrsensor - Name = Current
	
	//Outlet Voltage (Volts)
	private String voltage = null;	//nvoltsensor Name=Volt - Same for all Outlets
	
	//Outlet power (Watts)
	private String power = null;	//nsensor name - Act. Power


PDU Model. 
	//PDU current (Amps)
	private String current = null;
	
	//PDU voltage (Volts)
	private String voltage = null;
	
	//PDU total power (Watts)
	private String totalPower = null; 


Totals
  - The raritan does not give totals directly. Make routies to get the totals from the model after it has been refreshed.
